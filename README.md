Socialish is a decentralised digital DeFi social media platform based on Algorand blockchain technology that provides an ultimate user experience which gives the user a sense of belonging in the community, non-biased posts, high data security, privacy protection and monetized incentives. 

Socialish allows user to create, share, and trade unique contents using NFTs as a social media tool, but also introduces Socialish token rewards, boost, voting, DeFi feature that allows P2P token exchange. 

Aiming at bringing decentralization to the community, Socialish is revolutionizing the centralized digital social media industry today to a true Web 3.0 user experience. 

The common issues with a centralized social media platform today are about data ownership, data privacy, advertisement noise, increased bias from algorithmically curated feeds. 

Socialish aims at changing the dynamics in the social media space by putting our user, our community at the centre of the stage instead of the platform itself: 

Our user data are well respected and protected by the characteristics of blockchain technology: transparent, secure, trustworthy. 

All users are being rewarded with their participation on the platform which a centralised social media platform wonâ€™t be providing today. 

Our user is presented with non-biased content. Personalised AI algorithm today used on most of the social media platform only provides the users what they want to see, so they can never see both sides of the coin when only one side is presented to them. 

Providing P2P swap capability to trade between Socialish Tokens and Algos or ASAs.
